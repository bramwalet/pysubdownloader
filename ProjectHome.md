This Python script downloads subtitles from various subtitle sites. It uses both RSS feeds to keep up with new releases as wel as search existing databases.

You can use this script on Windows and Linux to automate the search of subtitles. See Wiki for install instructions, usage and features and limitations.

The script is written for Python 2.5 because setuptools is only available for Py 2.5 on Windows. I haven't tested the script in newer releases of Python.
