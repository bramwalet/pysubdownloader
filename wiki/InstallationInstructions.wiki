#summary Installation instructions for PySubDownloader

= Introduction =

On this page, I'll explain how to setup your Python libraries in order to use this script. 


= Installation =

This script is designed to work on every OS. I have tested it so far on Windows, but I'm planning on using it on my Synology DS207+ NAS with optware installed. So this script should work on every platform that has a Python interpreter and all required libraries.
 
 # Fist of all, you need Python 2.5, which you can download on the [http://python.org/download/releases/2.5.4/ Python official site] or install using your package manager.
 # When Python is installed, you have to install some required libraries:

  * libxml2 and libxslt are required prior to install lxml.
  * [http://codespeak.net/lxml/installation.html lxml] is required to parse HTML documents
   Install [http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall EasyInstall] and run easy_install lxml.  
  * [http://www.feedparser.org/ Universal Feed Parser] is required to parse RSS feeds.
